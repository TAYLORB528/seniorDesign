Individual Capstone Assessment

The senior design project we have chosen is a web application that we will deploy as web application and mobile application. From my perspective, this senior design project is all about learning about how to set up applications. This project is about learning to use APIs and how the database to backend connections work. This project is learning about how to set up file structure and code so that other developers can look at the codebase and quickly get an understanding of the project. This project will help to teach leadership and how to discuss ideas with teammates. I think this project will help me and my team learn more about full-stack development.
	For our chosen project, the college curriculum for Computer Science curriculum helps with the foundations of programming and logic. Most notably, in my opinion, would be Engineering Foundations (ENED1020), where they begin by teaching students MATLAB. MATLAB helped me to start thinking about problems programmatically and introduced me to logic programming. The class I would mark as the second most important would be Computer Science I (CS1021C), where students are introduced to C++. I believe that C++ is the best language to learn first because it introduces students to strongly typed variables and low-level programming. When I started at a low-level programming language, it made it easier for me to proceed to higher level programming languages such as Python and Java.
	My co-op experiences have been very valuable when thinking about the scope of my project. I started at GE Appliances and did two co-ops learning about web development and agile methodologies. In both of these co-ops I did largely frontend work using AngularJS. I, then, continued on to do three co-ops at Siemens learning more about web development and programming in languages such as JavaScript, AngularJS, and PHP. In my final three co-ops, I was fortunate enough to be able to work in the backend of a few projects and realized where my passion lies. I love doing backend and database work for web applications.
	I am excited to do this project because I enjoy working with applications. My ideal job in the future, as of right now, is to be a full-stack developer at a consulting company. I have had some experience as a full-stack developer at Siemens, and it was very satisfying to see the lifecycle of a project or a user story. My preliminary approach to designing a solution is to first choose which frontend and backend languages, and database platform to use. After deciding that, I would then move on to which features are the most important, and what functionality we need to implement to support those features. Finally, it is important to know the strengths of the people you are working with to know how to best assign tasks.
	The initial expected results of the application are that the user and the person/people they are with can decide on a movie. Additionally, based on movies they pick, we can recommend certain movies we think they would like. There are other features we would like to implement that havenâ€™t been scoped out yet. To self-evaluate, I would like for the UI to be inviting and useful for the user. I will know that I am done when my team and I have completed all features to the best of our ability. I would like to do some crowd testing of the application, and take criticism or things we could improve or add.
