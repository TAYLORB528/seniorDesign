## User Stories
- As a mobile user, I want to be able to use the app with people on other mobile OS's than my own.
- As a user, I want to have a profile where my categories are set up in advance (streamingservices, nearby restaurants, etc...)
- As a web user, I want a session to stay "alive" when I lose internet connection, so the process does not have to start again.
- As a web user, I want the application to wok on all web browsers so I am not constrained to using just one or two.
