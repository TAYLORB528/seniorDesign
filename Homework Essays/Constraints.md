Assignment 7: Constraints
The IT Cruisers

Social Constraint:
	One constraint is social, people will need to be able to use the app to quickly decide on some activity to do. This makes speed an important aspect of the project, as if the process of selecting something takes a long time, people will lose interest and opt not to use the app at all. Therefore we need to be cognizant of people's time and their ability to interact with one another in a quick manner to ensure the app does what it is supposed to do and doesn't just waste people's time. This will constrain our solution to quick ones, perhaps we may need to sacrifice some level of accuracy in order to ensure timely results.

Time Constraint:
	A major issue with any application development is encountering deadlines. Whether using an agile or waterfall development method, every aspect of a project has to be done at a certain point. You can’t begin to design the UI until the backend is structured. You can’t focus on UX if there is no UI. This step-by-step development makes for a good rotation of programming and review. Another issue that since apps are always being improved upon, it can be difficult to decide when something is finished. For instance, when is loading fast enough? Is there more optimization that we can achieve. These questions will need to be asked throughout the duration of our development cycle.

Scope Constraint: 
	Another constraint is the scope constraint. We all agree on the basic scope of the project, but there are other aspects of the project which may be implemented depending on how much time we have. One aspect of the project we haven’t agreed on is the user authorization for the application. This aspect of the application will be implemented given we have enough time. Other aspects such as, user settings, additional features, and secure sessions will be added given the time, again. And these aspects have not been discussed and therefore, not in the scope.

Technical Expertise:
	An additional constraint to this project is the technical expertise in our group. This project involves a lot of new technology that we have very little experience with. Another issue is our group has not dealt with deploying apps on the google store or ios store. So this project is going to require us to learn many new skills and have us learn a lot about the process of deploying an app. Another issue in this category is the fact that our experience with certain technologies varies a lot, so having everyone on the same page with the same understanding might be a challenge at some points of the project.
